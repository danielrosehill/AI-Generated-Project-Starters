# AI Generated Project Starters!

![alt text](images/banner.jpg)

The purpose of this repository is to provide a small aggregation of starters for web development projects generated by artificial intelligence (AI). 

As the capabilities of AI tools to generate accurate code increase over time, hopefully the utility of these code snippets will too. 

## Repository Structure
 
The repository is currently organized in the following fashion:

- Every project is organized into a folder describing the project. In the future, if I generate enough projects here, I might organize these individual project folders into categories, but for now, they're just at the root level.   
- Within every thematic folder, there is a prompt file, which contains the prompt which was used to generate the output.  
- Secondly, the project folders contain an output. The output is a copy and paste of the response returned from the LLM. Typically, I will use an instructional model, ideally one optimized for code generation, when using these prompts. At the time of writing, December 9th, 2024, I'm using Qwen 2.5 Coder accessed through Hugging Face. But in the future and for different reasons I might shift to different LLMs.

## Output Organisation

The mechanisms that make LLMs work also provide some innate variability in responses. While this is commonly thought of as a constraint for the code-generation use-case, it also enables little instances of creativity in the approaches that different models use.

If I collect more than one output for a specific code generation prompt, just as I do with the prompts, I will add them individually, whether through one aggregated outputs file or perhaps within a folder within the project folder.

## Model Selection

Just as with trying different prompts with different refinement strategies, I'll sometimes take the same code generation prompt and try it out with different LLMs. 

Frequently the differences in response can be quite significant. Different LLMs might recommend completely different approaches for achieving the same aim.

## Parameter Recording

Because the capabilities of large language models are so fast evolving, in addition to the prompts and outputs, wherever possible, I'll create a parameters file within the project folder in which I note the details such as the model used, and occasionally I'll also note the system instruction, as well as the temperature and top-P setting used. 

## Prompt Creation Process
 
 Sometimes, when writing prompts for code generation I go through several iterations. Frequently I will dictate the first prompt so it is quite open-ended and loose. Then, I'll use an LLM to organize the prompt textually with the instruction that it should optimize the prompt for code generation in an LLM specifically. In instances where both prompts are recorded - that is both the dictated prompt and the refined prompt - I'll include both (because sometimes the refined prompt is missing details or could be improved upon in its refinement.)

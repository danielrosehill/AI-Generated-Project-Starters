# Prompt for ridiculous cartoon racer game (bear vs sloth)

## Task Overview

Your task is to help me develop a **ridiculous online game** for my personal amusement. Below, I have outlined the concept, functionality, and specific requirements for the game. Your role is to provide detailed advice on implementation and development, ensuring all aspects of the game are addressed. Additionally, you are encouraged to suggest any extra features that could enhance the game's absurdity and entertainment value.

## Game Concept

### **Premise**
- The game is a **racing game** where players choose between two characters:
  1. **Cornelius the Sloth**
  2. **Jerry the Bear**
- The objective is to race through the streets of Jerusalem, starting at **Ben Yehuda Street** and ending at **Shuk Mahane Yehuda**, where the winner buys a pack of pita bread.

### **Game World**
- The terrain should be an **accurate representation of Jerusalem**, particularly the area between Ben Yehuda Street and Mahane Yehuda Market.
- The distance between the starting point and the destination is short (less than 1 km).
- The game world should be **geofenced**, restricting characters to obvious routes between the two locations.

### **Obstacles**
Players must navigate around typical urban challenges, such as:
- Pedestrian red lights
- Bystanders
- People taking selfies
- Other common city-related obstacles

### **Character Movement**
- Both characters should move at a **human running pace**, despite their natural tendencies (e.g., sloths being slow).
- Movement animations should align with their avatars:
  - Cornelius runs like a sloth (exaggerated but fast).
  - Jerry runs like a bear (bear-like but human-paced).

### **Game Modes**
- The game can be:
  - A single race.
  - A best-of-three series, where the first character to win two races is declared the overall winner.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Core Gameplay Mechanics:**
   - Players control their chosen character as they race to reach Mahane Yehuda Market first.
   - Collisions with obstacles or ignoring red lights result in time penalties.
   - The winner is determined by who reaches the finish line first.

2. **Graphics and Animation:**
   - Cartoon avatars of Cornelius and Jerry will be provided.
   - Characters should have unique animations:
     - Cornelius: A sloth running in an exaggerated manner.
     - Jerry: A bear running humorously at human speed.

3. **Game World Design:**
   - Use accurate mapping tools to replicate Jerusalem's streets.
   - Ensure that players can only navigate predefined routes between Ben Yehuda Street and Mahane Yehuda Market.

4. **Obstacles:**
   - Include dynamic obstacles such as:
     - Pedestrian red lights that force players to stop briefly.
     - Moving bystanders who block paths.
     - People taking selfies who slow down nearby players.

5. **Additional Features:**
   - Motion should match the provided avatars.
   - Add humorous sound effects (e.g., Cornelius grunting while running).
   - Include random events like sudden rainstorms or street performers disrupting gameplay.

6. **Optional Enhancements:**
   - You are free to suggest additional features that enhance the game's ridiculousness and amusement factor.
